					<p class="text-center text-secondary small">Most astrology misses the mark on what you should know about yourself‚Ä¶</p>

					<p class="text-center text-secondary small"> Explore the true essence of astrology‚ú®<br>
</p>


					<p class="text-center text-secondary small">The lunar phase of the moon shapes your life in ways you can hardly imagine‚Ä¶.

Just as her gravity governs the movement of the tides, we too are affected by her pull.

Our energy and emotions, receding and renewing as she moves through her lunar phases‚Ä¶

Because of this, the phase of the moon on your birthday has a lasting impact on your personality and potential for transformation.

You may know your Moon Sign... but do you know your Moon Phase,?

A friend of mine showed me this intriguing FREE personalized video Moon Reading that reveals not only your Moon Sign, but also your Moon Phase. 

She didn‚Äôt know her Moon Phase before her reading...but as soon as it started tears began to roll down her face. 

She learned she was born under Waxing Crescent Moon‚Ä¶üåí

A phase of the moon associated with wisdom, guidance and educating others.

What‚Äôs more, many other HUGE events in her life occurred under this specific Moon Phase...

So...are you ready to discover YOUR unique Moon Phase,?

Were you born under a Full Moon? üåï
Or a Waning Gibbous? üåñ

What does it say about your strengths, shortcomings and hidden talents?

>> Find out now with your Moon Reading gift.

Many Blessings,
